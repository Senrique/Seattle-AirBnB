# Seattle-AirBnB

This project is to do a brief data exploration on Seattle's AirBnB data. I will analyze the how the listings are distributed across different neighborhoods of Seattle, what are their features and how does the price vary across neighborhoods and time.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

Python: 3.7.1

Packages: os, folium, pandas, numpy, datetime, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn


### Installing

You can install python from this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-371/).

Packages can be installed using the 'requirements.txt' that is available in the repository.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Files used:
The analysis is present in the jupyter notebook - 'Analysis of AirBnB homes of Seattle.ipynb'. This takes input of 3 files-

* Listings, including full descriptions and average review score
* Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
* Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day
