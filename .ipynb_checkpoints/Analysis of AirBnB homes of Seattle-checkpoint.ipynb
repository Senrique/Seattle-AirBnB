       "3802  In a land ruled by condos, it's hard to find a house and a cute one at that, to rest your weary head. This craftsman style home was completely redone inside by the owner who built custom craftsman homes. There is a large yard to enjoy some city nature in, and everything in Fremont is only a few minutes walking distance. This home is in the heart of Fremont, one block south from the beloved troll under the bridge. Walk to PCC for some groceries or a quick bite, check out the Fremont Library, walk the Burke-Gilman Trail (or run it, depending on your idea of fun), and grab a bite to eat before checking out the shops -- or taking a tour of Theo's Chocolate Factory for dessert. This listing will comfortably fit 4 people. There is a queen bed in each room.   \n",

       "3802  Our rare for its location, 2 bedroom and 1 bathroom craftsman style home is located in the heart of Fremont. Just a couple minutes walk to find out what all the fuss is about. In a land ruled by condos, it's hard to find a house and a cute one at that, to rest your weary head. This craftsman style home was completely redone inside by the owner who built custom craftsman homes. There is a large yard to enjoy some city nature in, and everything in Fremont is only a few minutes walking distance. This home is in the heart of Fremont, one block south from the beloved troll under the bridge. Walk to PCC for some groceries or a quick bite, check out the Fremont Library, walk the Burke-Gilman Trail (or run it, depending on your idea of fun), and grab a bite to eat before checking out the shops -- or taking a tour of Theo's Chocolate Factory for dessert. This listing will comfortably fit 4 people. There is a queen bed in each room. No sharing. This house is a private home so you will have compl   \n",

       "3802  I loved living here before we had 3 kids. The things I loved to do: walk to PCC to have a delicious lunch and people watch, stroll by the troll up the block where lots of people come from all around to take a photo with him, go shopping in one of the boutique shops, check out a book or two from the library, eat at one of the many restaurants (favorites were Jai Thai and El Camino). I also loved to walk, jog, and ride my bike along the Burke-Gilman Trail. I've taken more than one tour of Theo's Factory and taste tested their different and delicious flavors of chocolate bar. The Woodland Park Zoo is a very quick drive or bus ride up the hill. Downtown Seattle is also a drive or bus ride away (maybe 10-15 minutes) and you can visit some amazing museums: Experience Music Project (EMP), Pacific Science Museum, Children's Museum, Seattle Art Museum, and more. Check out the view from the Space Needle, watch the sea life at the Seattle Aquarium (my favorite spot in Seattle), or just get lost i   \n",

       "26    The Queen Anne neighborhood is one of the most coveted areas in Seattle.  It is very safe and the residential streets are quiet, but Queen Anne Avenue is an easy walk or drive away, and bustling with activity, great restaurants, and shopping.  Seattle Center is right at the bottom of \"The Hill,\" and you can be in the middle of downtown Seattle in a few short minutes. There are several bus lines within a few blocks, and there is a bus stop one block away that runs straight into downtown.  The neighborhood is very walkable, and everything you need is right here.   \n",

There is street parking but it can be difficult to get. There is a paid lot behind our home and more paid lots situated around the neighborhood. We can tell you what the rate is and how to access the lot if you need some assistance.

       "23    Hello! We're Maggie & Alex, and we are very excited to share our home with you. Alex directs a non profit and Maggie works in the restaurant industry, and both of us love food, adventure, the outdoors, music & art. Maggie is a Seattle native and Alex has lived here for almost ten years, and we are passionate about exploring and sharing the beautiful place we call home. We spend a lot of time in the mountains and on the water, cooking meals for friends and practicing yoga. We are new to hosting, and we are excited to get started and make some great connections.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust let us know what you're looking for--tacos? Pho? Pastries? Five-star Dining? Craft cocktails? Indie rock? Hip hop show? Thrift stores? Museums? Bike trails?? Day hikes??? We've got all the goods on this amazing city, and we want to help you enjoy it to the maximum. We keep it pretty low-key around the house, and Alex goes to bed on the early side, so we do ask that you keep noise to a minimum in the evening hours, but the downstairs is your domain! We look forward to meeting you!   \n",
